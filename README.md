#AES implementation
### Advanced Encryption Algorithm (Rijndael)

- [x] two-way process of encryption and decryption with the same key
- [x] a sequence of characters serves as the key
- [x] encrypting data to safely store it
#### AES standards: 
- key lengths: 128, 192, 256 bits
- constant block size: 128 bits
